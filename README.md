# HRnet

## Link of project

[Application HRnet](https://lauranicolay-hrnet.netlify.app/)

## Description

This project is an internal web application, called HRnet, which manages employee records.
App was old and used jQuery on the front-end, which led to massive bugs and increased internal complaints.
[gitHub HRnet in jQuery](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P12_Front-end)
The whole app has been converted to React with in particular a jQuery plugin of your choice out of the 4 (date picker, modal window, drop-down menus or data table) to be converted into a component and to be done entirely without a package.
I chose the data table which I published on npmjs.com [npm data table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datatable_react_nicolay)
